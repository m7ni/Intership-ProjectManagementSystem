# Internship/Project Management System 

## Overview

Welcome to the Advanced Programming Internship/Project Management System repository! This project, implemented in Java, serves as an internship and project management system with a robust backend. The graphical interface was created using JavaFX, and the main focus of the project was on understanding and implementing various design patterns such as Factory, Facade, Memento, Singleton, and Finite State Machine (FSM). The project achieved a score of 85/100.

## Project Highlights

### Graphical Interface with JavaFX

The project features a user-friendly graphical interface developed using JavaFX. JavaFX provides a powerful set of tools for creating visually appealing and interactive user interfaces, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Design Patterns

The project incorporates several design patterns to enhance code structure, maintainability, and extensibility. Notable design patterns utilized include:

- **Factory Pattern:** Creating objects without specifying the exact class.
- **Facade Pattern:** Providing a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
- **Memento Pattern:** Capturing and externalizing an object's internal state.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensuring a class has only one instance and providing a global point of access to it.
- **Finite State Machine (FSM):** Modeling the behavior of an object with a finite number of states.

Understanding and implementing these design patterns contributes to a more modular and scalable codebase.

### Robust Backend Development with Java

The backend of the system is developed in Java, focusing on robustness and reliability. Key aspects of the backend development include:

- **Scalability:** Designing the system to handle a growing amount of data and users.
- **Performance Optimization:** Implementing efficient algorithms and data structures to ensure optimal system performance.
- **Reliability:** Building a system that is resilient to errors and failures, minimizing downtime.
- **Security:** Implementing secure coding practices to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Maintainability:** Writing clean, well-documented code that is easy to understand and maintain.

## Future Enhancements

Incorporating a database to elevate the functionality and data management capabilities of the Internship/Project Management System.
